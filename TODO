ToDo list for Release 1.1.0
============================

We've frozen release-1.1.0: no new features, only fixes.

During release preparation (aka stabilization), we can create new isses
describing buts that need to be fixed; those issues must be linked to the
corresponding mileston: v1.0.1. We need to complete the milestone before 
the release data (Dec 31 10:00 AM BRT).

To list all
    issues in milestone in v1.0.0, filter by:  milestone:v1.1.0
    pending issues in milestone v1.1.0, filter by milestone:v1.1.0 is:open

In the collumn 'Status', mark 'ok' when done, or leave it blank, otherwise.

        Delete all PRs created before the release freezing (Dec 13)
        Make sure that the milestone is fully completed by the release date.

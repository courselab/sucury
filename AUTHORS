 Sucury was written by the students of ICMC-USP.

 

 Sucury is a derivative work of KhobraPy.

 KhobraPy source code was originally written by Dr. Monaco F. J. as an
 educational tool to teach open-source development practices, tools and
 project management methodologies to graduate computer sciences students,
 at the University of São Paulo.

 Acknowledgments are due to the support from FOSS Research and Education Program
 of the Open Source Competence Center ICMC-USP, as well to all students and
 research colleagues who have provided valuable feedback.

 If you ever come to use this project to implement any programming course or
 instruction program, the athor would be glad if you let him know (monaco@usp.br).
